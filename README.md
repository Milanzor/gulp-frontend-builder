# Gulp Frontend-Assets-Builder-Thing

A gulp script for processing/concatting/compiling js/scss/jslib/bower_components etc

## Getting started

1. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to fetch all dependencies
2. Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json`, the contents of the sample are a good place to start
3. Run `gulp`
4. ?????
5. Profit!



## Notes

1. It's possible to pass the config file from a command line option with `--config ../path/to/config.json` (can be relative or absolute)
2. This builder currently assumes you have Gulp installed globally
